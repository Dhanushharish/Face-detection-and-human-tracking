# Face-detection-and-human-tracking using opencv 

This repository contains Python code for face detection and human tracking using the OpenCV library. OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library. This project focuses on detecting faces in images or video streams and tracking humans in real-time.

# Getting StartedðŸ’¥

Welcome to the Face Detection and Human Tracking project using OpenCV and Python! This guide will help you set up and run the project on your local machine.

*Prerequisites:*
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

1.[Install visual studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/)


2.[Python latest vresion](https://python.org/)

Based on your convinence you can download any one ,but python is necessity.

# FeaturesðŸ’«

Face Detection: Implement a robust face detection algorithm using Haar Cascade classifiers or deep learning-based models. Detect faces in images or real-time video streams with high accuracy.

Real-time Tracking: Track human faces and bodies in real-time video streams. Utilize techniques like object tracking to maintain continuity in tracking even with occlusions or changes in appearance.

Multiple Object Detection: Extend the project to detect and track multiple faces or humans simultaneously in the same video stream. Implement methods to handle overlapping detections and maintain separate tracks for each object.

Customization Options: Provide options for users to customize parameters such as detection thresholds, tracking algorithms, and output visualization settings. Allow users to fine-tune the system according to their specific requirements.

Performance Optimization: Optimize the performance of the system for real-time processing, especially on resource-constrained devices. Implement techniques such as parallel processing, hardware acceleration, and model optimization to achieve faster execution speeds.

# Package installation in cmdðŸ’¡
